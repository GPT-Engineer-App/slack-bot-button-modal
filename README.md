Slack bot for channel #990-test that sends a message with a button, and upon pressing the button, it opens a modal with forms for a new project. The forms include fields for 'ã‚¿ã‚¤ãƒˆãƒ«' (Title) and 'å‚™è€ƒ' (Notes). The language for the bot is Python, and it outputs the form results using print statements.
